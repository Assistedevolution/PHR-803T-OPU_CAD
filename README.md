# PHR-803T-OPU_CAD

The PHR-803T Optical Processing Unit has become popular with makers. To encourage use of this component we are sharing a basic projection mapped 3D model of the OPU.
The basic projection profiles are done in SolidEdge.

A course 3D model with basic dimensions is currently available
